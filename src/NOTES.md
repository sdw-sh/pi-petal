# Notes

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- set up a running system
    - a loadable config (contains at least the palm tree)
    - start up should be based on this config
    - system should be runnable with 
        - measurements
        - irrigation
        - scheduling
        - optional: display (should have a with hardware switch or push button)
- run this system continously
- add irrigation success check
- define concept for control buttons
- add control buttons

### Other

- Why is the logging of the events in the wrong order?
- Measurement and irrigation in parallel?
